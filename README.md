# FEM
SRAD Finite Element Model Solver for Fluid Dynamics

This code was developed as part of a Course Project for the Computacional Mechanics Subject.

It takes a triangular mesh created in Siemens NX and Neumann and Dirichlet conditions applied to certain nodes and calculates the potencial flow in a 2D body.

Use main_test.m and main_tri3.m as guides on how to use the code.
